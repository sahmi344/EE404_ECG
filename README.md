Found a ECG Module AD8232

The AD8232 ECG module is a cost-effective device designed to measure the electrical activity of the heart, providing an easy interface for microcontrollers like Arduino and facilitating health monitoring applications. 
The AD8232 IC is integrated into the module, which is primarily used for electrocardiographic (ECG) signal measurement.
It is capable of extracting, amplifying, and filtering biopotential signals even in noisy conditions, making it suitable for remote electrode placement 

The module offers essential pins for connections, including power supply and data output pins:
3.3V: Power supply (operating voltage: 2.0V to 3.5V).
GND: Ground pin.
OUTPUT: For analog ECG signal output.
LO+ and LO-: Leads-off detection pins to check for electrode disconnection 
Common applications include remote health monitoring, fitness trackers, and portable ECGs

Tried the installation Setup Using Arduino 
RED Color Indicates : Right Arm
Green Color Indicates: Left Arm
Yellow Color Indicates : Right Leg

Decide to using  Visual Studio Code instead of using Arduino ide . In the Visual Studio Code add the extension called as ESP IDF.  It is more convenient platform than Arduino IDE to do more functionable code.
